# Quickstart
This is an QuickStart bash script for those who are doing TryHackMe and are tired of doing the same again and again.  
What does this Script do ?
1) Easy one click connect to the Tryhackme VPN.
2) Create folder to keep things organised.
3) Automate the intial Scans like Namp and Gobuster [Note this is still in the developing stage]
4) Create a ReadMe text file and update the status of the Scans and Progress of the Machine.
5) Shows the list of Machines which you have solved.

Note: This is still a Developing project.
Thank you
